# AI Snake

### About
A pet project where I'm familiarizing myself with Python and TensorFlow.
In university I will be doing AI very soon(August 2019) using python and TensorFlow.
This project is my preperation for this AI course.  
(Turns out this code didn't turn out to be very useful preperation after all, but learning more python was fun.)

#### Progress
- [X] Make Snake 
- [ ] Integrate TensorFlow. 
- [ ] Add agent that can see tiles with distance 1 tile from its head, no diagonals. See results.
- [ ] Again but with diagonals. See results.
- [ ] Again but with longer observation radius.
